## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Maen Khaled

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing my data analytics skills through real-world projects and my ongoing training at Ironhack Berlin.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and Cloud Computing.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analytics, data engineering, and machine learning projects â€” especially those with practical business applications in e-commerce or SaaS.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advancing my expertise in building scalable data pipelines and applying advanced analytics to real-world problems.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data management, data integration, SQL, Python, MongoDB, or how to optimize data workflows in e-commerce.
